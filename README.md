See in it action [here](http://townsean.github.io/portfolio/)! (work in progress)

## Synopsis

Portfolio is a Vue.js web application that reads in json data and displays the contents in a digital resume format. 

## Motivation

I felt like I was stagnating as developer and wanted to learn Vue.js. Building a website version of my resume is a project that has been on my todo list. Learning by doing is a great way to make a lesson stick so I decided to learn Vue.js as I built this resume website.
