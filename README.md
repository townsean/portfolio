See in it action [here](http://townsean.github.io/portfolio/)! (work in progress)

## Synopsis

Portfolio is a Vue.js web application that reads in json data and displays the contents in a digital resume format. 

## Motivation

I felt like I was stagnating as developer and wanted to learn Vue.js. Building a website version of my resume is a project that has been on my todo list. Learning by doing is a great way to make a lesson stick so I decided to learn Vue.js as I built this resume website.

I also used this project as an opportunity to become more proficient with CSS, specifically with the [CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout). 

## Inspiration

I'm firm believer in giving credit where it's due. Prior to getting started, I looked online for inspiration and found several different website resumes. One of my favorites that I came accross was [Start Bootstrap's example resume](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/resume/). My website's layout and typography is largely inspired by this one. 

(I did avoid looking at the source for the example as the main purpose of this project is learning.)
